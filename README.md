This project is a web-based machine learning application that allows training and testing CNN and VGG16 models based on the Fashion MNIST dataset. The application was created using [Streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit).

# üìã Description

The application has the following functions:
1. Training the CNN model on black and white images (Fashion MNIST).
2. Training the VGG16 model on color images (converted from Fashion MNIST).
3. Visualization of training results, including loss and accuracy graphs.
4. Testing of images uploaded by the user based on the selected model.

# üõ†Ô∏è File structure

- `main.py` The script to run the Streamlit application.
- `app.py` The main module containing the application functionality, including model definition, training, visualization, and testing.

# Running the application

```bash
python main.py
```

Or directly:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

# üìä Models

## CNN:

Uses 2D convolutional layers.
The architecture includes Dropout to prevent overfitting.
Trained on 28x28 grayscale images.

## VGG16:

Pre-trained on ImageNet.
Input images are scaled to 32x32 with three channels (RGB).
Only the VGG16 main unit (frozen) is used.

# üñºÔ∏è How to work with the application

1. Training models
Select CNN or VGG16 in the menu.
Enter the number of epochs and click ‚ÄúTrain model‚Äù.
2. Testing
Upload an image in .jpg, .jpeg, .png, or .gif format.
Select a model (CNN or VGG16).
Click ‚ÄúRecognize image‚Äù.
3. Saving models
The trained models are saved in the saveModels folder in the `.keras` format.
